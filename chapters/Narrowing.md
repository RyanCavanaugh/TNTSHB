# Narrowing

Imagine we have a function called `padLeft`.

```ts
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {
    throw new Error("Not implemented yet!");
}
```

If `padding` is a `number`, it will treat that as the number of spaces we want to prepend to `input`.
If `padding` is a `string`, it should just prepend `padding` to `input`.
Let's try to implement the logic for when `padLeft` is passed a `number` for `padding`.

```ts
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {
    return new Array(padding + 1).join(" ") + input;
}
```

Uh-oh, we're getting an error on `padding + 1`.
TypeScript is warning us that adding a `number` to a `number | string` might not give us what we want, and it's right.
In other words, we haven't explicitly checked if `padding` is a `number` first, nor are we handling the case where it's a `string`, so let's do exactly that.

```ts
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {
    if (typeof padding === "number") {
        return new Array(padding + 1).join(" ") + input;
    }
    return padding + input;
}
```

If this mostly looks like uninteresting JavaScript code, that's sort of the point.
Apart from the annotations we put in place, this TypeScript code looks like JavaScript.
The idea is that TypeScript's type system aims to make it as easy as possible to write typical JavaScript code without bending over backwards to get type safety.

While it might not look like much, there's actually a lot going under the covers here.
Much like how TypeScript analyzes runtime values using static types, it overlays type analysis on JavaScript's runtime control flow constructs like `if/else`, conditional ternaries, loops, truthiness checks, etc., which can all affect those types.

Within our `if` check, TypeScript sees `typeof padding === "number"` and understands that as a special form of code called a *type guard*.
TypeScript follows possible paths of execution that our programs can take to analyze the most specific possible type of a value at a given position.
It looks at these special checks (called *type guards*) and assignments, and the process of refining types to more specific types than declared is called *narrowing*.
In many editors we can observe these types as they change, and we'll even do so in our examples.

```ts
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {
    if (typeof padding === "number") {
        return new Array(padding + 1).join(" ") + input;
                         ^?
    }
    return padding + input;
           ^?
}
```

There are a couple of different constructs TypeScript understands for narrowing.

## `typeof` type guards

As we've seen, JavaScript supports a `typeof` operator which can give very basic information about the type of values we have at runtime.
TypeScript expects this to return a certain set of strings:

* `"string"`
* `"number"`
* `"bigint"`
* `"boolean"`
* `"symbol"`
* `"undefined"`
* `"object"`
* `"function"`

Like we saw with `padLeft`, this operator comes up pretty often in a number of JavaScript libraries, and TypeScript can understand it to narrow types in different branches.

In TypeScript, checking against the value returned by `typeof` is a type guard.
Because TypeScript encodes how `typeof` operates on different values, it knows about some of its quirks in JavaScript.
For example, notice that in the list above, `typeof` doesn't return the string `null`.
Check out the following example:

```ts
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
    if (typeof strs === "object") {
        for (const s of strs) {
            console.log(s)
        }
    }
    else if (typeof strs === "string") {
        console.log(strs)
    }
    else {
        // do nothing
    }
}
```

In the `printAll` function, we try to check if `strs` is an object to see if it's an array type (now might be a good time to reinforce that arrays are object types in JavaScript).
But it turns out that in JavaScript, `typeof null` is actually `"object"`!
This is one of those unfortunate accidents of history.

Users with enough experience might not be surprised, but not everyone has run into this in JavaScript; luckily, TypeScript lets us know that `strs` was only narrowed down to `string[] | null` instead of just `string[]`.

This might be a good segue into what we'll call "truthiness" checking.

# Truthiness narrowing

Truthiness might not be a word you'll find in the dictionary, but it's very much something you'll hear about in JavaScript.
<!-- TODO: I'm on an airplane, is truthiness in the dictionary?? -->
In JavaScript, we can use any expression in conditionals, `&&`s, `||`s, `if` statements, and Boolean negations (`!`), and more.
As an example, `if` statements don't expect their condition to always have the type `boolean`.

```ts
function getUsersOnlineMessage(numUsersOnline: number) {
    if (numUsersOnline) {
        return `There are ${numUsersOnline} online now!`;
    }
    return "Nobody's here. :(";
}
```

In JavaScript, constructs like` if` first "coerce" their conditions to `boolean`s to make sense of them, and then choose their branches depending on whether the result is `true` or `false`.
Values like

* `0`
* `NaN`
* `""` (the empty string)
* `0n` (the `bigint` version of zero)
* `null`
* `undefined`

all coerce to `false`, and other values get coerced `true`.
You can always coerce values to `boolean`s by running them through the `Boolean` function, or by using the shorter double-Boolean negation.

```ts
// both of these result in 'true'
Boolean("hello");
!!"world";
```

It's fairly popular to leverage this behavior, especially for guarding against values like `null` or `undefined`.
As an example, let's try using it for our `printAll` function.

```ts
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
    if (strs && typeof strs === "object") {
        for (const s of strs) {
            console.log(s)
        }
    }
    else if (typeof strs === "string") {
        console.log(strs)
    }
}
```

You'll notice that we've gotten rid of the error above by checking if `strs` is truthy.
This at least prevents us from dreaded errors when we run our code like:

```
TypeError: null is not iterable
```

Keep in mind though that truthiness checking on primitives can often be error prone.
As an example, consider a different attempt at writing `printAll`

```ts
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
    // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    //  DON'T DO THIS!
    //   KEEP READING
    // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    if (strs) {
        if (typeof strs === "object") {
            for (const s of strs) {
                console.log(s)
            }
        }
        else if (typeof strs === "string") {
            console.log(strs)
        }
    }
}
```

We wrapped the entire body of the function in a truthy check, but this has a subtle downside: we may no longer be handling the empty string case correctly.

TypeScript doesn't hurt us here at all, but this is behavior worth noting if you're less familiar with JavaScript.
TypeScript can often help you catch bugs early on, but if you choose to do *nothing* with a value, there's only so much that it can do without being overly prescriptive.
If you want, you can make sure you handle situations like these with a linter.

One last word on narrowing by truthiness is that Boolean negations with `!` filter out from negated branches.

```ts
function multiplyAll(values: number[] | undefined, factor: number): number[] | undefined {
    if (!values) {
        return values;
    }
    else {
        return values.map(x => x * factor);
    }
}
```

## Equality narrowing

TypeScript also uses `switch` statements and equality checks like `===`, `!==`, `==`, and `!=` to narrow types.
For example:

```ts
function foo(x: string | number, y: string | boolean) {
    if (x === y) {
        // We can now call any 'string' method on 'x' or 'y'.
        x.toUpperCase();
        ^?
        y.toLowerCase();
        ^?
    }
    else {
        console.log(x);
                    ^?
        console.log(y);
                    ^?
    }
}
```

When we checked that `x` and `y` are both equal in the above example, TypeScript knew their types also had to be equal.
Since `string` is the only common type that both `x` and `y` could take on, TypeScript knows that `x` and `y` must be a `string` in the first branch.

Checking against specific literal values (as opposed to variables) works also.
In our section about truthiness narrowing, we wrote a `printAll` function which was error-prone because it accidentally didn't handle empty strings properly.
Instead we could have done a specific check to block out `null`s, and TypeScript still correctly removes `null` from the type of `strs`.

```ts
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
    if (strs !== null) {
        if (typeof strs === "object") {
            for (const s of strs) {
                            ^?
                console.log(s);
            }
        }
        else if (typeof strs === "string") {
            console.log(strs);
                        ^?
        }
    }
}
```

JavaScript's looser equality checks with `==` and `!=` also get narrowed correctly.
If you're unfamiliar, checking whether something `== null` actually not only checks whether it is specifically the value `null` - it also checks whether it's potentially `undefined`.
The same applies to `== undefined`: it checks whether a value is either `null` or `undefined`.

```ts
interface Container {
    value: number | null | undefined
}

function multiplyValue(container: Container, factor: number) {
    // Remove both 'null' and 'undefined' from the type.
    if (container.value != null) {
        console.log(container.value);
                              ^?

        // Now we can safely multiply 'container.value'.
        container.value *= factor;
    }
}
```

## `instanceof` narrowing

JavaScript has an operator for checking whether or not a value is an "instance" of another value.
More specifically, in JavaScript `x instanceof Foo` checks whether the *prototype chain* of `x` contains `Foo.prototype`.
While we won't dive deep here, and you'll see more of this when we get into classes, they can still be useful for most values that can be constructed with `new`.
As you might have guessed, `instanceof` is also a type guard, and TypeScript narrows in branches guarded by `instanceof`s.

```ts
function logValue(x: Date | string) {
    if (x instanceof Date) {
        console.log(x.toUTCString());
                    ^?
    }
    else {
        console.log(x.toUpperCase());
                    ^?
    }
}
```

## Assignments

As we mentioned earlier, when we assign to any variable, TypeScript looks at the right side of the assignment and narrows the left side appropriately.

```ts
let x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 10 : "hello world!";
    ^?
x = 1;

console.log(x);
            ^?
x = "goodbye!";

console.log(x);
            ^?
```

Notice that each of these assignments is valid.
Even though the observed type of `x` changed to `number` after our first assignment, we were still able to assign a `string` to `x`.
This is because the *declared type* of `x` - the type that `x` started with - is `string | number`, and assignability is always checked against the declared type.

If we'd assigned a `boolean` to `x`, we'd have seen an error since that wasn't part of the declared type.

```ts
let x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 10 : "hello world!";
    ^?
x = 1;

console.log(x);
            ^?
x = true;

console.log(x);
            ^?
```

## Control flow analysis

Up until this point, we've gone through some basic examples of how TypeScript narrows within specific branches.
But there's a bit more going on than just walking up from every variable and looking for type guards in `if`s, `while`s, conditionals, etc.
For example

```ts
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {
    if (typeof padding === "number") {
        return new Array(padding + 1).join(" ") + input;
    }
    return padding + input;
}
```

`padLeft` returns from within its first `if` block.
TypeScript was able to analyze this code and see that the rest of the body (`return padding + input;`) is *unreachable* in the case where `padding` is a `number`.
As a result, it was able to remove `number` from the type of `padding` (narrowing from `string | number` to `string`) for the rest of the function.

This analysis of code based on reachability is called *control flow analysis*, and TypeScript uses this flow analysis to narrow types as it encounters type guards and assignments.
When a variable is analyzed, control flow can split off and re-merge over and over again, and that variable can be observed to have a different type at each point.

```ts
function foo() {
    let x: string | number | boolean;

    x = Math.random() < 0.5;

    console.log(x);
                ^?

    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
        x = "hello";
        console.log(x);
                    ^?
    }
    else {
        x = 100;
        console.log(x);
                    ^?
    }

    return x;
           ^?
}
```

# Discriminated unions

Most of the examples we've looked at so far have focused around narrowing single variables with simple types like `string`, `boolean`, and `number`.
While this is common, most of the time in JavaScript we'll be dealing with slightly more complex structures.

For some motivation, let's imagine we're trying to encode shapes like circles and squares.
Circles keep track of their radii and squares keep track of their side lengths.
We'll use a field called `kind` to tell which shape we're dealing with.
Here's a first attempt at defining `Shape`.

```ts
interface Shape {
    kind: "circle" | "square";
    radius?: number;
    sideLength?: number;
}
```

Notice we're using a union of string literal types: `"circle"` and `"square"` to tell us whether we should treat the shape as a circle or square respectively.
By using `"circle" | "square"` instead of `string`,  we can avoid misspelling issues.

```ts
interface Shape {
    kind: "circle" | "square";
    radius?: number;
    sideLength?: number;
}

//cut
function handleShape(shape: Shape) {
    // oops!
    if (shape.kind === "circel") {
        // ...
    }
}
```

We can write a `getArea` function that applies the right logic based on if it's dealing with a circle or square.
We'll first try dealing with circles.

```ts
interface Shape {
    kind: "circle" | "square";
    radius?: number;
    sideLength?: number;
}

//cut
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
}
```

<!-- TODO -->
Under `strictNullChecks` that gives us an error - which is appropriate since `radius` might not be defined.
But what if we perform the appropriate checks on the `kind` property?

```ts
interface Shape {
    kind: "circle" | "square";
    radius?: number;
    sideLength?: number;
}

//cut
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    if (shape.kind === "circle") {
        return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    }
}
```

Hmm, TypeScript still doesn't know what to do here.
We've hit a point where we know more about our values than the type checker does.
We could try to use a non-null assertion (a `!` after `shape.radius`) to say that `radius` is definitely present.

```ts
interface Shape {
    kind: "circle" | "square";
    radius?: number;
    sideLength?: number;
}

//cut
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    if (shape.kind === "circle") {
        return Math.PI * shape.radius! ** 2;
    }
}
```

But this doesn't feel ideal.
We had to shout a bit at the type-checker with those non-null assertions (`!`) to convince it that `shape.radius` was defined, but those assertions are error-prone if we start to move code around.
Additionally, outside of `strictNullChecks` we're able to accidentally access any of those fields anyway (since optional properties are just assumed to always be present when reading them).
We can definitely do better.

The problem with this encoding of `Shape` is that the type-checker doesn't have any way to know whether or not `radius` or `sideLength` are present based on the `kind` property.
We need to communicate what *we* know to the type checker.
With that in mind, let's take another swing at defining `Shape`.

```ts
interface Circle {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}

interface Square {
    kind: "square";
    sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;
```

Here, we've properly separated `Shape` out into two types with different values for the `kind` property, but `radius` and `sideLength` are declared as required properties in their respective types.

Let's see what happens here when we try to access the `radius` of a `Shape`.

```ts
interface Circle {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}

interface Square {
    kind: "square";
    sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;

//cut
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
}
```

Like with our first definition of `Shape`, this is still an error.
When `radius` was optional, we got an error (only in `strictNullChecks`) because TypeScript couldn't tell whether the property was present.
Now that `Shape` is a union, TypeScript is telling us that `shape` might be a `Square`, and `Square`s don't have `radius` defined on them!
Both interpretations are correct, but only does our new encoding of `Shape` still cause an error outside of `strictNullChecks`.

But what if we tried checking the `kind` property again?

```ts
interface Circle {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}

interface Square {
    kind: "square";
    sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;

//cut
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    if (shape.kind === "circle") {
        return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
                         ^?
    }
}
```

That got rid of the error!
When every type in a union contains a common property with literal types, TypeScript considers that to be a *discriminated union*, and can narrow out the members of the union.

In this case, `kind` was that common property (which is what's considered a *discriminant* property of `Shape`).
Checking whether the `kind` property was `"circle"` got rid of every type in `Shape` that didn't have a `kind` property with the type `"circle"`.
That narrowed `shape` down to the type `Circle`.

The same checking works with `switch` statements as well.
Now we can try to write our complete `getArea` without any pesky `!` non-null assertions.

```ts
interface Circle {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}

interface Square {
    kind: "square";
    sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;

//cut
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    switch (shape.kind) {
        case "circle":
            return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
                             ^?
        case "square":
            return shape.sideLength ** 2;
                   ^?
    }
}
```

The important thing here was the encoding of `Shape`.
Communicating the right information to TypeScript - that `Circle` and `Square` were really two separate types with specific `kind` fields - was crucial.
Doing that let us write type-safe TypeScript code that looks no different than the JavaScript we would've written otherwise.
From there, the type system was able to do the "right" thing and figure out the types in each branch of our `switch` statement.

> As an aside, try playing around with the above example and remove some of the return keywords.
> You'll see that type-checking can help avoid bugs when accidentally falling through different clauses in a `switch` statement.

Discriminated unions are useful for more than just talking about circles and squares.
They're good for representing any sort of messaging scheme in JavaScript, like when sending messages over the network (client/server communication), or encoding mutations in a state management framework.

# The `never` type

```ts
interface Circle {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}

interface Square {
    kind: "square";
    sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;

//cut
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    switch (shape.kind) {
        case "circle":
            return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
        case "square":
            return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    }
}
```
