# Basic Types

In this chapter, we'll cover some of the most common types of values you'll find in JavaScript code, and explain the corresponding ways to describe those types in TypeScript.
This isn't an exhaustive list, and future chapters will describe more ways to name other types.

## Primitives

Each primitive type in JavaScript has a corresponding type in TypeScript. As you might expect, these are the same names you'd see if you used the `typeof` operator on a corresponding value:

* `string` represents string values like `"Hello, world"`
* `number` is for numbers like `42`. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there's no equivalent to `int` or `float` - everything is simply `number`
* `boolean` is for `true` and `false`

> The type names `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that shouldn't appear in your code. *Always* use `string`, `number`, or `boolean`.

## Arrays

To specify the type of an array like `[1, 2, 3]`, you can use the syntax `number[]`; this syntax works for any type (`string[]` is an array of strings, and so on). This is equivalent to writing `Array<number>` - `Array` is a built-in generic type, and we'll learn more about generics later.

Note that `[number]` is a different thing; see the later chapter on *tuple types*.

## `any`

TypeScript also has a special type, `any`, that you can use whenever you don't want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

When a value is of type `any`, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type `any`), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that's syntactically legal:
```ts
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of these lines of code are errors
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```

The `any` type is useful when you don't want to write out a long type just to convince TypeScript that a particular line of code is okay.

## Inference

<!-- this section is bad -->

When you initialize a variable with a value, TypeScript infers the type of that variable based on the initializer, and prevents changes to the type of that variable later on.

For example, this code is assumed to be an error, because changing the type of a variable from `string` to a function is usually not what you meant to do:
```ts
let myName = "Alice";
// Forgot to call the function!
myName = myName.toUpperCase;
```
This inference process happens automatically, but you can be more explicit if you'd like:
```ts
// Equivalent to the first line of the prior sample
let myName: string = "Alice";
```

## Function Declarations

Functions are the primary means of passing data around in JavaScript. TypeScript allows you to specify the types of both the input and output values of functions.

Parameter type annotations go after the parameter name:
```ts
// Parameter type annotation
function greet(name: string) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name.toUpperCase() + "!!");
}
```
Note that for a function *declaration*, parameter types are never inferred.

Return type annotations go after the parameter list:
```ts
function getFavoriteNumber(): number {
    return 26;
}
```
If there isn't a return type annotation, the return type of a function will be inferred from the function's `return` statements (in other words, the annotation in the above sample doesn't change anything). Whether or not you include a return type annotation is usually personal preference.

## Function Expressions

Function expressions are a little bit different from function declarations. When a function expression appears in a place where TypeScript can determine how it's going to be called, the parameters of that function can be automatically given types.

Here's a concrete example:
```ts
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"];
names.forEach(function (n) {
    console.log(n.toUppercase())
});
```
Even though the parameter `n` didn't have a type annotation, TypeScript used the type of the `forEach` function to determine the type it should have.

This process is called *contextual typing* because the *context* that the function occurred in informed what type it should have. Later, we'll see more examples of how the context that a value occurs can modify its type.

## Object Types

The most common sort of type you'll encounter is an *object type*.
This refers to any JavaScript value with properties, which is almost all of them!
The syntax for an object type is a list of properties inside `{ }`.

For example, here's a function that takes a point-like object:
```ts
// The parameter's type annotation is an object type
function printCoord(pt: { x: number, y: number }) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.y);
}
printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });
```
Here, we annotated the parameter with a type with two properties - `x` and `y` - which are both of type `number`.
You can use `,` or `;` to separate the properties, and the last separator is optional either way.

This example used an object type *anonymously*, that is, without giving it a name.
This can be convenient, but more often, you'll want to give these types names so that you can refer to them in multiple places.

## Naming Object Types

There are two ways to give a name to an object type, and they're very similar.

### Type Aliases

A *type alias* is exactly that - an *alias* for any *type*.
The syntax for a type alias is:
```ts
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

// Exactly the same as the earlier example
function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.y);
}
```

You can actually use a type alias to give a name to any type at all, not just an object type.
We'll see many examples of this later.

Note that aliases are *only* aliases - you cannot use type aliases to create "different" versions of the same type.
When you use the alias, it's exactly as if you had written the aliased type.

### Interfaces

An *interface declaration* is another way to make an object type:
```ts
// Using commas instead of semicolons for variety, but either would work
interface Point {
  x: number,
  y: number
}
```

### Differences Between Interfaces and Type Aliases

Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely.
Here are the most relevant differences between the two that you should be aware of.
You'll learn more about these concepts in later chapters, so don't worry if you don't understand all of these right away.

* Interfaces may be `extend`ed, but not type aliases. We'll discuss this later, but it means that interfaces can provide more guarantees when creating new types out of other types.
* Type aliases may not participate in declaration merging, but interfaces can.
* Interfaces may only be used to declare object types.
* Interface names will *always* appear in their original form in error messages, but *only* when they are used by name.
* Type alias names *may* appear in error messages, sometimes in place of the equivalent anonymous type (which may or may not be desirable).

For the most part, you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will tell you if it needs something to be the other kind of declaration.
